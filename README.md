# Won 2nd in the pokitdok category at the Angelhacks Silicon Valley hackathon

Healthcare has been around for a long time, however it has still been largely accessible by the consumers themselves. Consumers don't know information about what they are paying towards insurance, prescriptions, and health services. Using our service, all this data is graphed out using Pokitdok's detailed APIs and charts.js to the average consumer. It is hosted on a web application with clean, minimalistic graphs to convey this information in an intuitive, helpful way. Consumers will be able to visualize their health care options and compare prices in order to save money.
